# h7 - SecuDream

This is my stream-of-conciousness description of a cyber security course of my dreams.

## Goals

After the course, the student:

- Is able to better the status of both their personal and their professional cyber security in a tangible way (Change a setting, start a new practice, perform checks)
- Knows the potential effects of contextually insufficient cybersecurity measures (the hermit in the off-grid cabin needs different considerations than the cloud security consultant)
- Knows both the technical as well as the behavioural basics of preventing cyber security attacks and recovering from them.

## Outline & Framework

My dream course would be an intense one, lasting about two working weeks. In my experience, an intense training like this can yeild great results. For the first week I would like the course to focus on the technical aspects of things, suited for the technical level of the participants.

- First, a notion that cyber security no longer depends on computers and fancy hacker stuff but is a concept more or less present, as a part of general information security, in everyone's lives every day.
- Second, to truly understand the WHY: Why would somebody want to steal information, disrupt services or compromise hardware. What are the attackers' motivations.
- A look at technical examples suitable for the group to further advance understanding.

The second week could focus on the human side of things. How we are objects of influencing and how not all influencers are benevolent. Increase awareness of what affects our behaviour and how we can tackle that.

## Exercises

I would like to mention that I enjoyed the exercises of my Haaga-Helia cybersecurity course. Hash breaking and port scans, for example, were things completely unfamiliar to me before the course. It was very informative to get to know those concepts and I would like to have exercises like that as a part of any cyber security course. To install Linux on a virtual machine is also good practice. In my opinion, all exercises should be teacher-led and individual with the requirement of documentation to make sure the people actually understand what they are doing. The course should be as hands-on as possible and everybody should be spending a lot of time looking at a computer and configuring things, since that is the essence of cyber security. It would then be more fruitfull to build the human understanding on top of the technical knowledge.

## Visiting lecturers and other specials

My dream course would have many visiting lecturers along with the main lecturer. Over a two-week period I would like to have a visit-lecture about a niche topic almost every day. In my opinion the best would be to have guests give short lectures about the "topic of the day" from a specific point of view, with discussion or Q&A. Changing lecturers are good for keeping it fresh.
