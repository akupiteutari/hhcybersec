## Feed reader

x) Frankly speaking I did not know what a feed reader is as I started working on this task. Nor did I have any idea how or why somebody would want to use one. I though I might as well turn to ChatGPT and used the prompts "Explain the concept of feed reader to a beginner" and "In the context of cyber security, why would you want to use a feed reader?" After familiarising myself with feed reader as a concept, I could make sense out of the outputs of the latter prompt. Feed readers can be used as quasi-dashboards to follow specific type of content and based on that, trigger alerts and automate workflows. Useful things to have available to help monitor an environment.

## Osuuspankkikeskus port scan case in the Finnish supreme court

y) The case was about the Finnish banking cooperative OPK demanding damages for attempted data breach. The defendant had done a port scan of the cooperative's network in order to seemingly connect to the internet from the cooperative's proxy server.

- Lower degrees of justice had first deemed the defendant not guilty and later guilty. The defendant appealed to the supreme court.
- The defendant claimed that he had not attempted to breach the system but only to scan it, since port scanning software by design is not used to perform a breach but only a scan.
- The supreme court pointed out that "breach" in this context is a figure of speech used to describe the unauthorised nature of a procedure such as the scanning performed by the defendant. Even an attempt to find out usernames of a system is punishable as an attempted data breach, if done with the purpose of penetrating a system without authorisation.
- The defendant claimed that his meaning was only to look for an open proxy server or other information of interest. The supreme court deemed that the type of port scanning software used by the defendant is not required to permissibly find this type of information on the internet
- The supreme court deemed that the port scanning had been done systematically and that the defendant's claim was not credible.
- The supreme court deemed the defendant guilty and decided to not allow settlement of damages. This was due to the expertise and experience of the defendant, despite his young age (17 years at the time of the crime)

To the reader: My apologies, I was not able to fit this into any less points. Yes I like legal stuff, thanks for asking!

Feed list with Schneier added

d) 

I Googled "security rss feeds" and navigated to Cyber Security hub which seems to list a bunch of cyber security related RSS feeds:

I copy-pasted the links for Articles feed and Demos feed and added them on Thunderbird (showing at the top of the list):

e) I find the same thing to be the upside as well as the downside: The subscription list is curated by you, meaning your chance of randomly stumbling on something new and interesting outside the given scope are slim. Meanwhile, subscribing to feeds is extremely good at serving the purpose of getting that curated look at what is new in spaces you want to follow.

First port scan

Install apache2

<img width="702" height="618" alt="{BD1DC455-53AD-4E07-B4E5-7D6F336DF52E}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f43fa3d-1959-4a74-9e2b-9f3d062cc498" />

Second port scan after installing and starting apache2 and disconnecting from network.

Differences in scan results:

This is the port list after the first scan

<img width="444" height="161" alt="{679710AE-1EB8-4843-A0A1-38C04E2F1915}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/994116b4-dae6-4e14-8563-27e742fa764b" />

This is the same portion after the second scan

<img width="525" height="253" alt="{F8029270-0407-4478-8249-11D114E38167}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a46bccc3-1d45-4aac-a3e3-86af1eaffd1a" />

The second scan shows that apache was installed successfully and that it is currently running. The way I understand this is that apache2 is now installed and listening to http traffic. This way the computer could be used to host a web site.
