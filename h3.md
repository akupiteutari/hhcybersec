## Summary of 2020 article by Karvinen "Command Line Basics Revisited"

- The article is an introduction to the use of mainly Linux computers by employing the command line instead of a graphical user interface
- The command line can be used to perform basic computer tasks such as install software, manipulate files and organise directories
- An important security "feature" is SSH remote control, enabling one to perform tasks on a remote computer in a secure way

- My idea: My limited experience as a private Linux user is not extensive enough for me to have learned to really utilise the command line. However, it is a good skill to have and I should work on it.

## Summary of 2022 article by Karvinen "Cracking Passwords with Hashcat"

- Hashcat is a password cracking program that uses dictionaries to brute force through passwords
- It can be used to get familiar with the concept of password cracking
- Right from the start it should be noted that it is paramount to stay safe, legal and ethical

- My idea: The simplicity of brute forcing like this is a good demonstration of the importance of secure passwords.

This is my virtual machine with Debian 13 Trixie installed, made using Oracle Virtualbox. I did the installation following instruction in class since I had no previous experience of such virtualisation. I was able to complete the installation.

Looking at the head of the file

Analysing hash type

Problem! Not enough allocatable memory. My first guess was to increase computer memory on virtualbox and try again.

<img width="778" height="347" alt="{6323BA9E-C53C-47A3-B2A4-B6FB32ABDC05}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6a862b5-814d-40c0-857e-8314d3a8adfd" />

Lo and behold! I increased the vm base memory and got the hash cracked.

And there we have it. Hashcat - installed. Attempt at hash cracking - made and failed. Problem - solved. Successfull attempt - made. Hash - cracked.
