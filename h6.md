## Tasks

x) Traficom Cybermeter summarized

- The Cybermeter assessment is done in five steps, each step consisting of different procedures performed by different roles. The key role is that of Assessment facilitator who oversees the entire process.
- The Cybermeter maturity model is a four-level (0-3) model used to describe the cybersecurity capabilities of a target organisation. At the root are domains of cybersecurity (risk management, situational awareness & workforce management etc). The domains have objectives attached to them and the objectives are further measured by practices.
- Per each of the domains, the organisation will receive a maturity indicator ranging from 1 to 4. Target levels should always be set according to the organisation's business sector, business objectives and risk assessment.
- The details of the assessment are presented in the Cybermeter maturity report, aimed to help internal development.
- The tool used for the assessment is a simple Excel spreasheet where evaluations of the organisation's status are filled. Cybersecurity domains all have designated sheets.

a) Make-belief analysis

Alice, Bob and Charlie are discussing Cybermeter. They work in a telecommunications company. Alice is a customer service agent, Bob a system specialist and Charlie a sales coach. They are discussing the cybersecurity maturity of the company's customer service.

A: I work with around ten systems daily, have access to several more and I know that even more exist. I know all the systems I use are listed on a page I use to access them. Of course I can't directly access databases but they also exist.
B: So there is a list, and in fact there is pretty compehensive documentation of all of the company's systems, I participate in maintaining it. I would say this practice is mostly implemented.
C: The customer service agents also do sales. There is a lot of competence support material and sales trainings recordings and I don't think those are really listed anywhere, though I would have to confirm with my boss.
A: Yeah, there are also team-level channels and a lot of private conversations on Teams, many of which contain customer information. That is definitely sensitive information if you think of a cyber attacker. I'm not sure if all of that even can be listed the way the tool intends to.
B: And there are systems that are no longer in use but still have all information intact. Those are still listed also.
C: And even if they weren't consistently, an ad-hoc list could be put together rather quickly. Section 2b is definitely not fully implemented and I'm not even sure it's partly implemented.

b) Sucks or succeeds

To take on a full Cybermeter assessment is a gargantuan effort for an organisation. Any organisation with the means to complete the assessment would probably do wisely to hire an external facilitator. Companies facing heavy regulation might have great potential (banking, telco, health) as the assessment might help their internal development. On the other hand most businesses are very small and improving their cybersecurity capabilities might prove even more helpful and the fruit might be lower-hanging. In his 2023 thesis, Teemu Pirkkalainen presents the results of an assessment on a medium-sized company not operating in a cybersecurity-critical industry. The company was found to follow cybersecurity practices in a limited way or not at all. In employee interviews it was still found that the company's workforce had knowledge of cybersecurity. So, in this case the Cybermeter might not have been that useful no matter how well-orchestrated the tool itself is.

c) Competition

With cyber security being all the rage these days, all kinds of companies offer their packages of assessment. At least companies named Metricstream and Check Point seem to have developed software for the purpose. With a very competitive market, many of the tools are certainly more than enough to serve the purpose. Howevery, they are always developed from a business stand point whereas Traficom operates on a non-profit basis with no agenda other than to promote cyber security. They also only provide the tool and do not, for example, sell facilitation as a service. Cybersecurity center also encourages organisations to share their results to find out more about best practices. Also, organisations should also consider their legal environment and for Finnish companies, Cybermeter is therefore definitely the way to go. Developing a comprehensive tool requires knowledge of local law as well as legislation differs between countries also in terms of information security.
