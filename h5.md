x) Summary of chapters 1.1 "Terminology" and 2.5 "Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography" of Applied Cryptography by Schneier (2015)

- Cryptography exists for many purposes, some of which are authentication, integrity and nonrepudiation. These principles make sure that encrypted information is traceable, or in the case of blockchain, that "everything is on the chain".
- Cryptography works using algorhitms and keys. Keys are not necessary for encryption and decryption but they highly increase security. Security is even further enhanced by using different keys for encryption and decryption.
- Cryptoanalysis is the science of recovering information intended to be secret and hence cryptoanalysis is essentially an attack against the algorhitm.
- Algorhitm security can be discussed in many terms, some of which are unconditional security (unbreakable no matter how much ciphertext is known) and computational security (current or future computing power is not enough to solve the algorhitm). Since nobody knows just where computer evolution is going, computational security is always open for debate.
- The article points out that cryptography and methods of encrypting information are also used outside of IT. You can speak of secrets in front of your child if they don't know the language you are using.
- Communications with public key cryptography range from the use of personal private keys through the use of database-residing public keys all the way to the use of session keys.
- Merkle's puzzles by Ralph Merkle were one of the first demonstrations of public key cryptography. The puzzles enable individuals to communicate in an encrypted way without using keys. The idea is that the algorhitm must be broken using a brute-force attack, which is far easier to do for the recipient of the message than it is for an attacker.

a)  

I use Whatsapp for daily communication and, according to Meta, the communication is end-to-end encrypted, meaning the encryption takes place between the physical devices of the sender and the recipient of the message. The rough process is as follows:

- The sender requests key from Whatsapp server
- The recipient's device verifies
- The sender saves the recipient’s Identity Key, Signed Pre Key and the One-Time Pre Key
- The sender loads their Identity Key and calculates Master Secret
- The recipient calculates another Master Secret that corresponds to that of the sender
- Both parties derive their own Root Key and Chain Key from the Master Secret
- After these initiation procedures, messages in the conversation are encrypted and decrypted using Message Keys calculated from the Chain Key

b) 

I simply chose a random encryption tool I googled (Link in references). Highly questionable for any serious use.

An overly simple example.

c)

A passive eavesdropping attack is negated by PGP by facilitating the use of a public key to encrypt the message and using a private key to decrypt it. Only the party with the appropriate private key can decrypt.
An active attack is trickier. Firstly, the message's authenticity and integrity are ensured by using digital signature to help the recipient make sure the message really is from the correct sender and that it has not been changed during delivery. Another key thing is fingerprint verification: The sender imports the recipient's public key, meaning the message cannot be decrypted by another key.

KeePass installed on my PC. It auto-hides (smart) on any attempt to screenshot it but here is a description of the steps I took:

- Create Database
- Name it "Passwords" with no description
- Choose the default KDBX database format and the default 100 millisecond decryption time. Also leave advanced settings at defaults.
- Set up database credentials
- Store the database on my computer
- Add an entry to the database

I also use KeePass for all work passwords but will not risk sharing anything from there.
