# h1 - CyberScience

For this task I was to find and review a review article. I started searching for one, following instructions given by the professor.
My topic of choice was social engineering. I went to Google Scholar and searched for "intitle:review social engineering".
I came across a 2024 article by Femi-Oyewole ea titled "A Systematic Review of Social Engineering Attacks & Techniques: The Past, Present, and Future".
I checked the JUFO rating of the publisher on the JUFO portal and found out they have a JUFO level of 1. The criteria for the publisher, topic
and freshness of the article had been met.

## Key areas of research

- Social engineering (manipulating people's behaviour to access sensitive information)
- Types of social engineering attacks
- Detecting social engineering attacks
- Challenges and open problems
- Future trends in social engineering attacks

## Consensus

- The danger of social engineering attacks lies in their targeting of the human factor, often the weakest link in cyber security
- Social engineering attacks aim to steal information: login credentials, financial information or personal information etc.
- Methods for detecting attacks and protecting information are in growing demand

## Open questions

- What is the single most effective way to protect organisations against social engineering attacks
- How to deal with attacks orchestrated in (human) languages other than English
- How to raise awareness
