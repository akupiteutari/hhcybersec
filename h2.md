# h2 - Scene

For this task I was to consume and summarize a podcast episode and a blog post. For the blod I chose the Traficom NCSC News
blog. In the spirit of following the scene I chose the "Cyber Weather in September 2025" post to see news as fresh as possible.
In the last assignment I reviewed an article on social engineering and here I will attempt to link information from that review
together with the findings in the Traficom blog post. It should be noted that the blog post is in fact a condensed translation
so I decided to look at the original post written in Finnish. For the podcast I chose the October 15th 2025 episode of
the Herrasmieshakkerit podcast based on the fact that media holds a great responsibility for helping people become knowledgeable
in matters of cybersecurity. These matters are often technical and complicated and explaining them in a way accessable to the
regular person is crucial.

## Blog post summary

- M365 account are being stolen more and more and used to send phishing messages
- Several Finnish high-profile organisations were targets of Denial-Of-Service attacks
- A wide-range malware attack bothered air passenger traffic in Europe, resulting in flights getting delayed or cancelled
- The Finnish government is proposing new legislation to complement the EU data protection act, providing individuals with
- more extensive rights to their data and authorising public parties to access private sector data in an "exceptional situation",
- which was not very widely reported in the news.

- My idea: This is significant to every possessor of data-collecting devices, and IMO it should have been all over the news.
- I think the public simply does not understand this well enough to find it relevant.

## Podcast summary

- The episode was visited by the Eero Hyvönen, lawyer, journalist and the chairman of Julkisen Sanan Neuvosto
- (the Council for mass media in Finland, short JSN)
- The topic of discussion was the role, funding and activity of JSN as well as media responsibility and disinformation
- Mr Hyvönen finds clickbait titles not only accectable but necessary so journalistic work would not go to waste
- Hyvönen noted that all views on different topics are not equal and not all voices deserve to be heard
- This is where media holds a great ethical responsibility for providing the public with reliable information
- JSN can judge media parties but their judgement will never result in a fine - only an obligation to publish the JSN decision
- It was noted that algorhithms are able to steer conversation on public matters
  
- My idea: JSN is an incredibly important agency and the key thing is that even though they are the primary regulators
- of media, their judgement will never have direct financial repercussions on organisations.
- JSN is only in it for the sake of truth-seeking journalism.

## How does this link to social engineering?

According to the Traficom blog, phishing attacks continue to increase in volume and complication and are causing
other attacks as well (stolen M365 accounts used to send phishing messages). Phishing is the most common and the most effective
type of cyber attack because it targets the human factor in the grand scheme of cyber security. Awareness of social engineering
is becoming more and more important and people should aim to become better at recognising threats and acting accordingly.
The Finnish government proposal on the EU data act is also noteworthy since it enables public officials to access data 
of private sector parties and requires organisations such as cloud service providers to enable a simpler exchange of information.
All of this increases the likelihood of peoples information getting in the wrong hands and being used for social engineering.
The Herrasmieshakkerit podcast on the other hand mainly focused on the role of media. Free speech should be used responsibly
and Eero Hyvönen accurately pointed out that all views on different topics are not equal or deserving to be published.
Misinformation is another tool of social engineering since it can be used to invoke fear, which in turn will dim judgement.
